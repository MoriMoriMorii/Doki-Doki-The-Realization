How to play
Heya! 
If you're reading this, you must be wondering how you play the game right?
Well, its pretty simple.
1. Download and extract the .zip file using whatever means you need to take (Most will use their built in extractor like win zip)
2. Copy the files from the folder into the ddlc game folder (Make sure to not delete pre existing files, as this will break the game and the installation of ddlc)
3. Run ddlc and enjoy this short shitpost quality of a mod!
